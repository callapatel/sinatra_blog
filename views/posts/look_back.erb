<div class = 'postspace'>  <article>    <h2> Looking Back </h2></br></br>        So I recently just completed my 6th week at ADA -- thats 25% complete of in class sessions. WHAT?! I usually        freak out before thinking so again, insert the 100th freakout of ADA. Its weird to have people believe in you        when you sometimes doubt yourself. But, that enviornment makes us professional athletes of brain power. Seriously,        LOOKING BACK I would've never had these opportunities had I stayed at Macys. My previous boss really beat us down        and I knew if I stayed there any longer I would likely quit dreaming and get wrapped up in the day to day.        Those people are soul crushers and we should probablly just say some random curse word. But those people are terrible!        We should build up those around us. Being at ADA makes me feel smart, smart for making the choice, and for learning to solve        problems. Its also a really great feeling to push yourself.. daily. Anyways, going on.</br>        There are all these awesome things about ADA but they remind you in your interview that this is tough. You wouldn't be there        if you couldn't handle tough. Last week though, I was so tired. On Friday I had to tell myself        'you can make it through this.' Espresso really helped too. So on Wednesday night when the tired was REALLY hitting me        I randomly thought to myself, it'll be great to review my application video. Cause thats embarassing! I watched it, and        I still don't get why you would want to take me on to a second interview with that terrible video. Its so embarassing, haha.        But then I went on to review my markdown files in gist... our technical reading which did not make sense at all to me        when I wrote it - was the hardest part of my application. It was like 'oh, I hope this is right.'        Well when I read it over, I'm excited and glad to say.. I KNOW WHAT ALL OF THAT JARGON MEANS! Its all about installing        gems, understanding what gems do, and using Rspec. WHAT?! I seriously understand all of this. What a feeling.        Its exciting to see for 6 weeks in -- I get this. Part of the issue with ADA is confidence, we all have the skills.        Now its re-insitlling confidence that I feel like women forget about. Hey, we're way too humble. :) </br>        The rest of the week while we tackled Rails!! RAILS! Going on, I felt super confident. And thought rails was awesome        for kicking our bootys. But it also came together quicker for me since I felt ok with not knowing things, I know I'm able        to figure it out. </br>        So week 6, Rails is hard. Rails is new. I'll get it.  </article></div>

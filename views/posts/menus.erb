<div class = 'postspace'>  <article>    <h2>Why are drop downs so hard?! Learning about readjusting.</h2>    This past week or so we've been working on our blogs - and tada how do you like it? Well, I still have huge hopes for it    so I'll continue updating. Anyways, from day one I simply just knew I wanted/needed a drop down menu.    What says hot shot like a drop down menu? Now, think of every site you are on and how drop down menus are essentially    everpresent on any site. These things have to be simple! NOT. No, not at all. In fact I went days without    succeding at a drop down menu. I came in with the goal, spent various hours on it, read code, read more code. And just couldn't    get it to function. Until... the day Jquery & JS performed as the sun would, and removed the clouds that    clouded my day. Post lecture on these topics, I just knew I was no longer using HTML and jumping ship to JS.    </br>    I believe it was a smart choice on my part to use JS because JS acts as the handler for anything behavior related.    Things such as hover and clicks were what we were introduced to and I completely thought my drop down menu really flowed,    mentally, through the JS process rather than that lackluster little HTML I have going on.</br>    Originally with my HTML menu I couldn't git my rectangle to adjust so that it centered under the menu header text I needed it to.    Yes, yes I removed all the padding. Often times when I run into a huge roadblock, I'll re-thing the steps to completing    the issue at hand. I'm able to revaluate. Things that I ended up struggling over were fixed with less lines of code, and    less complexity. By finding this quick, magical, and just as good as a HTML drop down fixed I felt way more comfortable    with javascript. It made me feel like it was an approachable switch because I was able    to quickly make changes, and easily figure out solutions that worked for the better of my site.  </br>See below for my quick fix:  </br>    $( "#blog" ).mouseover(      function() {        $( ".dropdown ").slideToggle();      });    </br>    After this I just toggled around wth my CSS sheet and made a div class that could adjust my dropdown to land in the right    area on the site.    </br>    WA-LA! Its like magic.   </article></div>

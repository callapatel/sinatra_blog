<div class = 'postspace'>  <article>    <h2> Know your Verbiage & Pair Programing</h2></br></br>    As a current student at ADA academy I have to tell you the importance/ultimate cool factor of pair programming.    I recall my interview when I asked our main instructor in my roundabout way of asking tough questions at inappropriate times, “so, I keep hearing about pair programming – why is it such a big deal/how important is it?”    Well Bookis answered in the most appropriate, responsible way. In fact we just started pair programming in class. It started as the feeling of “oh I don’t know how people disagree and take it personal when working it pairs” to writing a hash angrily on my computer as my pair watched.    I finally got the nerve to step up and tell my partner my feelings so she could understand, and from that point on it was a much better learning experience.    I even took a lot away from studying my partner’s habits; things that are menial like writing my methods differently even to writing return (eeek). But the bigger takeaways were; learn to talk to your partner in whatever language they speak and girl, work harder, um.. everyday. </br> </br>    Now what I mean by speaking to your partner in the language they prefer is maybe learning the terminology they like to speak in ruby. There are so many people who will talk like the textbook and some, like myself, who just like to have verbal dialogues in their brain and then try to break it down the most they can but prefer to show with examples.    With my pair programming instance (insert drums here) my partner and I couldn’t understand one another! Everyday I’d come home and try to digest and break down what was discussed, then read up on making sure I had all my definitions concrete and could implement that knowledge.    Yes, I was drawing diagrams and constantly quizzing myself. But that’s the takeaway, keep learning.    The moment I learned how to look at my ruby program the way my partner did we were able to discuss and I was able to help her (finally). </br></br>    Ultimately, I feel stronger when discussing ideas with other people and it only took me just a little bit of extra work.    Its awesome, I feel way more confident about showing my code and I know I’ll have many more instances where I have different learning opportunities through pairing.    Also, pairing.is.awesome.  </article></div>
